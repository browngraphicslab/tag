Touch Art Gallery (TAG) - v0.5b

Brown Graphics Lab




Installation requirements:

Windows 8 computer w/ a developer's license or sideloading-enabled



To install:

Right click on "Add-AppDevPackage.ps1" in the app folder and select "Run with PowerShell".




Known issues:


* Bringing up the touch keyboard in Authoring mode and then undisplaying it causes the screen to distort. Going to another screen and returning restores the screen appearance.


*  Image uploading stalls occasionally. This may be due to the BackgroundUploader not contacting the server. Uninstalling the app and restarting your computer can bring everything back to normal. Note, uploading a big image can take a long time, so do not mistake these two behaviors.

Upcoming features for Version 1 release:


* Add Artwork Description text field to Artwork authoring mode, and "Overview" to the View mode sidebar for artworks
* Tool tips for graph labels and keyword search



* 'Loading' wheel will appear in place of thumbnails in Catalog while loading
